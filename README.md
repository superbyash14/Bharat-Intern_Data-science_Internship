# Bharat-Intern_Data-science_Internship

## Overview

Welcome to the repository showcasing my hands-on learning journey in Data Science, where I applied theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. In this repository, you will find details about the theoretical concepts explored and three practical projects implemented using Python: SMS Classifier, Titanic Classification, and Cat and Dog Image Classifier.
## Hands-on Learning
### Description

Over the course of this Data Science exploration, I have engaged in hands-on learning, bridging the gap between theory and real-world application. Theoretical concepts were put to the test through practical projects, providing a deeper understanding of the data science lifecycle.
Projects
# 1. SMS Classifier
#### Description

Developed a text classification model to categorize SMS messages as either spam or non-spam using advanced data science techniques in Python.
Files

   - sms_classifier.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the SMS Classifier project.
   + data: Folder containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.

#### How to Use

   1. Open sms_classifier.ipynb using a Jupyter Notebook environment.
   2. Execute each cell sequentially to understand the project workflow and implementation.
   3. Explore the data folder to access the dataset used for training and testing.

# 2. Titanic Classification
#### Description

Built a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using various data science techniques in Python.
Files

   + titanic_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the code for the Titanic Classification project.
   - data: Folder containing the Titanic dataset used for model training and evaluation.

#### How to Use

   1. Open titanic_classification.ipynb using a Jupyter Notebook environment.
   2. Follow the step-by-step implementation to understand the process of creating the predictive model.
   3. Check the data folder for the Titanic dataset used in the project.
